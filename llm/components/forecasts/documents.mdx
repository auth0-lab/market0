## **Explained Prompt**: Show me forecast for ZEKO

<UseCase type="authorization-rag" />

### Scenario

When a user submits a forecast inquiry for a specific company, like Zeko, the chatbot will generate a response using relevant documents retrieved from the vector store. By default, Market0 will only include publicly available filings. However, users may also have access to analyst-level forecasts, providing them with additional insights when the response is generated.

Okta Fine Grained Authorization (FGA) is used to check which documents the user has access to based on their permissions.

### How it works

1. **User Forecast Request**: The user requests a forecast for a specific company, such as ZEKO.
2. **Document Retrieval**: Market0 handles the request and employs a retriever to search its vector store for documents relevant to the requested information. It applies filters to ensure only the documents the user has access to are considered.
3. **Response Generation**: Based on the retrieved documents, Market0 compiles a tailored response for the user. Depending on user's permissions the response could be based on analyst-level forecasts.
