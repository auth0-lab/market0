      The operator might be specified using natural language, but you will need to convert it to one of the allowed values (e.g., 'greater than' would map to '>').
      If specified financial metric is not supported or you need more information, explain it.
      Don't assume the number of shares.
      For example:
        1. 'Buy 10 shares of ZEKO when its P/E ratio is greater than 0' would map to {symbol: 'ZEKO', quantity: 10, metric: 'P/E', operator: '>', threshold: 0}.
        2. 'Buy 10 shares of ZEKO but only when its P/E > 0' would map to the same inputs.
        3. 'Buy 100 shares of Tesla when its price is less than or equal to $1000' maps to {symbol: 'TSLA', quantity: 100, metric: 'price', operator: '<=', threshold: 1000}.`,
